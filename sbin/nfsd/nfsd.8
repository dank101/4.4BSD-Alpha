.Sh NAME
.Nm nfsd
.Nd remote
.Tn NFS
server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nfsd
.Op Fl r
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl t
.Op Ar numprocs
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Nfsd
runs on a server machine to service
.Tn NFS
requests from client machines.
At least one
.Nm nfsd
must be running for a machine to operate as a server.
The options
.Fl u
and
.Fl t
are used to indicate which transport protocols are to be served.
.Pp
Options available to
.Nm nfsd :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl r
Register the
.Tn NFS
service with
.Xr portmap 8
without creating any servers. This option can be used along with the
.Fl u
or
.Fl t
options to re-register NFS if the portmap server is restarted.
.It Fl t
Serve
.Tn TCP NFS
clients.
.It Fl u
Serve
.Tn UDP NFS
clients.
.It Ar numprocs
Specifies how many servers to fork off.
.El
.Pp
If neither
.Fl u
or
.Fl t
are specified,
.Ar numprocs
servers for
.Tn UDP
transport are started. (compatibility)
If
.Ar numprocs
is not specified, it defaults to 4.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal
nfsd \-u \-t 6
.Ed
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
Serves
.Tn UDP
and
.Tn TCP
transports using 6 daemons in the kernel.
.Pp
A server should typically run enough daemons to handle
the maximum level of concurrency from its clients,
typically four to six.
.Pp
.Nm Nfsd
listens for service requests at the port indicated in the
.Tn NFS
server specification; see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC1094.
