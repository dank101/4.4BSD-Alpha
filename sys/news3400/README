This Sony RISC workstation support is done as a sub-project in WIDE research
project.  Sony Corp. contributed device drivers and gave us great
technical supports.  Kazumasa Utashiro worked mainly for 4.4-alpha porting
but that work was based on 4.3-Reno port helped by other project members,
Tadamichi Matsuyama and Hidetoshi Unno.

This version is just a snapshot of developing system and has many
unimplemented feature and bugs.  I hope this will be more stable in
final 4.4BSD release.  Please contact utashiro@sra.co.jp if you have any
comment about this code.  Bugfix will be greatly appreciated.

I've been using NWS-3200 laptop machine for development.  Only 3200's LCD
display is supported now.  You can use this kernel on 3400 by serial line
console, but it is not tested well.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Config command is not changed to support NEWS because it will be changed
to support dual processor machine in the future.  Diffs are in CONFIG.DIFF
in /sys/news3400 directory.

GCC 2.x has a problem to build library objects.  Usually library object is
made by following way:

	cc -c x.c
	ld -r -x x.o
	mv a.out x.o

But using gcc 2.x (at least 2.2.2), some objects made by this way can't be
linked.  ld complains that the object has bad isym.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known bugs:
	- Floating point doesn't work always.
	- Display driver is slow.
	- Serial line driver is slow.
	- Reboot doesn't work.
	- NFS doesn't work (it worked before...)
	- System hangs when ^S is typed from bitmap console.
