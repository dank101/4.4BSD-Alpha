.BP aardvark
The ``Dungeon Definition Language'' processor has been updated to
run on 4.3BSD, so that games such as aardvark now work again.
.BP battlestar
A third generation adventure game.
.BP canfield
The user interface has been improved so that one need not type so many
carriage returns between games.
Players are charged a maximum of
three minutes of think time between moves should they put a game
on hold for an extended period of time.
.BP fortune
Has yet more adages
(not better ones, just more).
.BP hunt
The latest addition, a maze battle game for multiple players.
.BP mille
Now plays slightly more intelligently,
and prevents discarding of safeties.
.BP robots
Much like the old game of chase, except different.
.BP rogue
Has been made more of a scoundrel.
