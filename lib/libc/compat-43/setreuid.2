.Sh NAME
.Nm setreuid
.Nd set real and effective user ID's
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn setreuid "int ruid" "int euid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This interface is made obsolete by:
.Ef
.Xr seteuid 2 .
.Pp
The effective user ID's of the
current process is set according to the
.Fa euid
argument.
The real user ID's of the
current process is checked to ensure that it matches
either the real or saved ID of the process
(thus ensuring that it can later be restored to the effective ID).
If
.Fa euid
is -1, the current uid is filled in by the system.
If
.Fa ruid
is -1, the check on real ID above is skipped.
Unprivileged users may change the effective user
ID to the real user ID or the saved user ID;
only the super-user may make other changes.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.  Otherwise,
a value of -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width [EPERM]
.It Bq Er EPERM
The current process is not the super-user and a change
other than changing the effective user-id to the real user-id
or saved user-id was specified.
